The steps were explained in detail in the methodology part of the thesis.

## CSV Files
- Compiled raw data used in preprocessing are the concatenated version of features.csv and labels.csv files. 
- labels.csv represents the mass loss (wt% wf)
- Rest of the changes and intermediate files generated depend on the preprocessing part (which could be the main focus for the further improvements)
